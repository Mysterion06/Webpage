                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a variety speedrunner since 2016. My first ever speedgame was Resident Evil 4 on the ps2. In
                    2018~ I
                    also started running <br>
                    Devil May Cry 3 and 4. DMC4 unfortunately had no autosplitter back then, that is the reason why I
                    started
                    coding. Thanks to my <br>
                    laziness of splitting the timer by myself I had the goal to create an autosplitter for this game. I
                    only
                    managed to create a portion <br>
                    of the splitter from what it is today. I left the project open with the mindset to finish it one
                    day. August
                    2019 I took coding as my <br>
                    primary class in high school, all because of the dmc4 splitter that had caught my interest. During
                    the
                    pandemic in July 2020 I picked up <br>
                    the project again, with more knowledge this time. I managed to finish the dmc4 splitter and was
                    asked to
                    also improve the dmc3 splitter <br>
                    then the dmc1 and dmc2 splitter and so on. (Documentation under <a href="Autosplitter.html"
                        style="color:#D3BA7F">Autosplitter</a>)
                    Since then I was recommended from runner to runner to <br>
                    create several splitters and since July 2021 also SRTs. Coding has become a big part of my life and
                    I am
                    looking forward to learn new <br>
                    things everyday and improve my knowledge even further.
