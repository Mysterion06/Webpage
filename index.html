    <h1>About Me
        <p style="font-size: 30px; word-spacing: 2px;">
            I am a variety speedrunner since 2016. My first ever speedgame was Resident Evil 4 on the ps2. In
            2018~ I
            also started running <br>
            Devil May Cry 3 and 4. DMC4 unfortunately had no autosplitter back then, that is the reason why I
            started
            coding. Thanks to my <br>
            laziness of splitting the timer by myself I had the goal to create an autosplitter for this game. I
            only
            managed to create a portion <br>
            of the splitter from what it is today. I left the project open with the mindset to finish it one
            day. August
            2019 I took coding as my <br>
            primary class in high school, all because of the dmc4 splitter that had caught my interest. During
            the
            pandemic in July 2020 I picked up <br>
            the project again, with more knowledge this time. I managed to finish the dmc4 splitter and was
            asked to
            also improve the dmc3 splitter <br>
            then the dmc1 and dmc2 splitter and so on. (Documentation under <a href="Autosplitter.html"
                style="color:#D3BA7F">Autosplitter</a>)
            Since then I was recommended from runner to runner to <br>
            create several splitters and since July 2021 also SRTs. Coding has become a big part of my life and
            I am
            looking forward to learn new <br>
            things everyday and improve my knowledge even further.
