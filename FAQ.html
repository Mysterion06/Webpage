                            <p>Speedrunning involves completing a video game as quickly as possible, often using specific strategies,
                                 glitches, or techniques to achieve the fastest time. It can be competitive and is usually recorded and shared with a community.</p>

                            <p>I started speedrunning in 2016. My first speedrun was with <em>Resident Evil 4</em> on the PlayStation 2.</p>

                            <p>My primary speedruns include <em>Resident Evil 4</em> and the <em>Devil May Cry</em> series, particularly <em>Devil May Cry 4</em>. 
                                I have also worked on speedrunning other games and coding tools related to speedrunning.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>I started coding around 2018 when I was speedrunning <em>Devil May Cry 4</em>. The lack of an autosplitter for the game pushed me to learn coding to create one myself.
                                 This experience sparked my interest in coding, which I later pursued as a primary subject in high school.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>An autosplitter is a tool used in speedrunning to automatically track and split a game’s time into segments, without needing manual input.
                                 It makes timing more accurate and allows the runner to focus entirely on gameplay.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Initially, it was a mix of necessity and curiosity. I didn’t want to manually split times during runs, and the challenge of coding my own solution intrigued me.
                                 Over time, my interest in coding grew, and I became passionate about improving and creating new tools for the speedrunning community.</p>

                            <p>SRTs (Speedrun Tools) are additional tools used by speedrunners to assist with tracking various aspects of a run.
                                 Since July 2020, I have been creating and improving SRTs for different games based on the needs of the community.</p>
