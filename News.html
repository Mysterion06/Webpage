                        I reworked the design of the website a little bit. I added a FAQ tab, though I am still thinking on what to do with the Home page. <br>
                        I also finished my Elden Ring SRT, by including a Hotkey function to show and unshow the Boss Status.

                        I updated the website, by adding the commission tab and also adding content to the support tab. <br>
                        Currently I am trying to find an idea what code. Whether it should be for a game, maybe a totally different program <br>
                        or whatever possibilities I have. Its hard to find inspiration at the moment.

                        I updated my Elden Ring SRT to also work with the new DLC that came out. I also reworked the toggle news slider button. <br>
                        Now the javascript is much cleaner, with that I dont have to recreate a new toggle for every month + year. <br>
                        Currently trying to decide what to code or what program/game I should work next. I am maybe thinking to get more into modding and create some other tools.

                        I reworked the Website, removed the Speedruns tab and added the SRTPluginManager one, in there you can check out how the SRTPluginManager works. <br>
                        In the future I will probably create a new header, that will have a different Design (Maybe Dropdown?). <br>
                        I also worked on a new SRT for Elden Ring. After I played it through, I wanted to check my Bosses that I have killed in real time and which ones
                        are still alive. With that I also created my first DirectX Overlay and in the Overlay it is also sorted to the current Area you are in. <br>
                        In the SRT Tab you can check out more.

                        I have taken 2 new commissions, the first one is a splitter + igt display for SANABI. The second
                        one is a bigger project. <br>
                        I am supposed to create a save state tool (Something like Fallout and Skyrim have) for the games
                        Harry Potter 4-7. 7 has 2 versions, so its 5 <br>
                        invidiual games I have to do it for. Currently I am working on 4 and also got an old coder
                        friend on the boat with me. I had already found a <br>
                        few poitners and I had already created a console based tool, but with his suggestion, we decided
                        to switch to a dll injection for the game, <br>
                        which works much better. Now we are trying to find out more about collisions and how we can
                        manipulate them. <br>
                        Also the first commission is already finished, with this news update, I will also add it to the
                        Autosplitter section.

                        I've decided to learn a little bit of LUA. Currently I am playing World of Warcraft, thats why I
                        have decided, to create an Addon for the game. <br>
                        The Addon includes a pop up window ingame, that shows you all Mounts in the game, which you
                        already own, where you can get them (Vendor, Drop etc) <br>
                        and you can also sort them, so it only shows what you want to look at. It's still WIP, but maybe
                        in the future, I will feature it on here, when I am <br>
                        happy with the work.

                        I got commissioned for Alien Shooter, which I have already finished. I was asked to create a
                        start and split <br>
                        function. The autosplitter is now available on Livepslit.

                        I've started working on this Website again. Ive updated my Autosplitter and SRT section with all
                        of my work. <br>
                        Next I will work on the "Speedruns" section and possibly upload all my personal bests Ive had so
                        far. <br>
                        Im also thinking about updating the design of this website, because its my design from early
                        2022 and since then <br>
                        I've improved a lot in my HTML/CSS skills

                        Recently I was commissioned to do the The Evil Within 2 Splitter, which I will start working on
                        soon. <br>
                        I finished my Autosplitter section, by adding all the important Splitters I have created in the
                        past 2 years. <br>
                        Upcoming week I will attempt to finish the loadremover for Ninja Gaiden Black and also make the
                        new DMC1Splitter official
                        once the mods allow me to upload it. I also added my SRTs to the SRT section.

                        I started working on the DMC1Splitter and was asked by Waifu to create a Loadremover and I did
                        so. <br>
                        Soon I will rework the autosplitter. I also added a few of my splitters to the Autosplitter tab.

                        autosplitters &lt February 2021 and those that really need some finetuning<br>
                        So that would include the splitters:
                        <li>Star wars jedi fallen order</li>
                        <li>Devil May Cry 1</li>
                        <li>Devil May Cry 2</li>
                        Will only take a maximum of 1-2 commissions now, to prevent an overflow when reworking my old
                        splitters.
